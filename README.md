I am submitting this Pull Request as a formal public notice.

I did not consent to be listed as a contributor to this repository.

Since Issues are disabled, this is my only way to communicate this request.

Please remove any commits or authorship under my name (`pydevtop`) immediately.

Failure to do so will result in escalation to GitHub Support as a Terms of Service violation.

This serves as an official record of my objection.
